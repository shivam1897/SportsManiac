	Jerry West Leaving Warriors For Consultant Role With Clippers 
	</h1>
	<img src=" https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---DlfrhN0--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/hxg9detjnkqytlmseuv0.jpg"/>
	<p>
	Scarcely two days since the Golden State Warriors won the second title in three years, Jerry West is leaving the team to become a special consultant to the Los Angeles Clippers.

West has held a similar role with the Warriors for the past six seasons. His decision to leave the team had been brewing over the last several months, due in part to a reportedly strained relationship with the ownership group, as first reported by Jack McCallum of Sports Illustrated. When Golden State won the NBA championship on Monday night, West already knew he would be leaving and gave parting words to Draymond Green and Kevin Durant amidst the chaos of the team’s celebration. From SI:

“I’m telling you it was one of the saddest, if not the saddest night of my life,” West said on Wednesday night, speaking from his home in Bel-Air. “These were six of my happiest years. To be around a team like this, with these kind of guys … well, I’ve been around a long time, and I can tell you it’s a rare experience.”
The Clippers’ front office currently offers a far more difficult outlook than Golden State has over the last few seasons, but West, 79, seems to be up for the idea of a challenge:



The Clippers have no draft picks this year, and their two biggest stars—Blake Griffin and Chris Paul—both have the ability to opt out of their contracts this summer to become unrestricted free agents. That means West will play a role in either ensuring that they stick around, or figuring out how to build a foundation without them.

 
Before his time with the Warriors, West won six championships as general manager of the Lakers and then served five years as general manager of the Grizzlies.

	The Golden State Warriors exorcised the demons of their blown 3-1 lead last season and reclaimed their place atop the NBA summit Monday night with a 129-120 Game 5 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers at Oracle Arena.

Kevin Durant, who was named Finals MVP, led the way with a Finals career-high 39 points (14-of-20 shooting) seven rebounds and five assists as the Warriors hoisted their second Larry O'Brien Trophy in three years.

According to Elias Sports Bureau (via ESPN Stats & Info), Durant became the first player since Shaquille O'Neal in the 2000 NBA Finals with five straight 30-point games in a championship setting.

Stephen Curry joined Durant as the Warriors' other primary spark plug.<br/><br/>

Following an uncharacteristically sluggish Game 4 that saw him sputter to 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting (2-of-9 from three), Curry rebounded by stuffing the stat sheet with 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.

Not to be overlooked was Andre Iguodala, who dropped a 2017 playoff-high 20 points (9-of-14 shooting, 2-of-7 from three) in a showing that conjured up memories of his MVP-caliber performance in 2015, per ESPN.com's J.A. Adande:

 Led by Iguodala, Warriors reserves outscored Cavaliers subs 35-7.

LeBron James (41 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists) and Kyrie Irving (26 points, six assists) did their best to counter the Warriors' offensive blitz, but an off night from Kevin Love—who was limited to six points and was minus-21 in 29 minutes—and shaky bench showing prevented Cleveland from landing a late haymaker.
However, the Cavaliers—who shot a robust 53.4 percent from the field—weren't always pressing.

In fact, they looked like the aggressors early as Golden State battled turnover problems and lethargy.<br/><br/>

Although the Warriors trailed 41-33 with 10:14 remaining in the second, they steadily chipped away at that deficit and eventually took a 45-43 lead midway through the frame.

At that point, momentum was trending entirely in the Dubs' direction. A 16-2 spurt helped propel Golden State in front by as many as 17, and Curry's and-1 floater punctuated the tide-turning run:

 The Golden State Warriors losing the 2016 NBA title to the Cleveland Cavaliers after taking a 3-1 series lead haunted Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, coach Steve Kerr and the rest of the team from the front office down. The decision was made that they had to do something drastic, that they wouldn't lose again. The Warriors couldn’t take any risks trying to win another Larry O'Brien trophy. One massive extra push in the form of superstar Kevin Durant joining the ranks would no doubt get them past LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and the defending champions from Ohio. That was the logic.

Why Kevin Durant Had to Blow Up His Life to Get His Shot
What happens when the game's kindest star starts pursuing his own joy
They were correct. The Warriors, who cruised through the post-season, only dropping a single game throughout, defeated the Cavs to reclaim the top spot in the league. Bouncing back from a Game 4 thrashing that saw Cleveland opening up the game with 49 points in the first quarter and 86 first-half points overall, both the most in NBA Finals history. If Golden State wanted to close things out, they had to overcome losing the previous game, but they really had to overcome their demons. They had to put last year out of their minds. 

Game 5, however, was back on home turf. Oracle Arena was rocking before tip-off, and even though the home team still carried a 3-1 lead, enough to become champs with just one more victory, the tension was maybe never higher for a fifth game. If they let Cleveland in the back door, Golden State could be in big trouble. As the Warriors learned, James and the rest of the Cavs can make a series lead vanish if you let them.

The first two quarters were a battle, with the teams trading off leads. Things got chippy, with some shoving that led to technicals players from both teams, but Golden State pulled away on the strength of long-range shooting and ended the half up 11. <br/><br/>


Cleveland put up a fight in the second, threatening multiple times to take over the game towards the end of the third, trailing by five going into the fourth. But in the end, the Warriors, with Durant leading the way, were just too good to hold off. 

After a post-season that wet, for all intents and purposes, exactly how people figured it would go, the Warriors did have a scare on their way to closing out one of the great seasons in NBA history. And with the talk that Durant, Curry and Andre Iguodala all looking to stay in the Bay even though they each have the option to become free agents and sign lucrative deals elsewhere, it's a forgone conclusion that Golden State is definitely the very large mountain all other teams will have to climb if they want to be the next champs. It's hard to imagine that not being the case for the next few years to come. This second title in three years very well could be one of many more. This could very well be an all-time great basketball teams. 

As for Cleveland, they still have James, they still have Irving and the free agent pool is deep. If the Warriors are the favorites, their rivals in Cleveland, the Lakers to the Celtics (or vice versa) for this generation, aren't far behind.

But for now, the Golden State Warriors are rid of their demons. Durant finally has a ring and he won it on one of the single most dominant squads in NBA history. The future, it seems, is very bright.

 2017 NBA Finals: Biggest Winners And Losers
 </h1>

 The Golden State Warriors completed one of the greatest all-time playoff performances in NBA history with a 129-120 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers to win the championship four games to one. The Warriors finished their playoff run as the first team with a 16-1 record in the postseason. It marks the team’s second NBA title for the Warriors in three years as they staked a claim as a modern-day dynasty.

Here are the biggest winners and losers from the 2017 NBA Finals.<br/><br/>
Kevin Durant

Durant lamented that he was sick of finishing second (draft, MVP voting, Finals) in a 2013 Sports Illustrated cover story. Durant is second no more.



The four-time scoring champ crushed his good-guy image when he left Oklahoma City to don the black hat in the Bay Area as a free agent last summer. Some will view Durant as piggy-backing on the Warriors' success, but history should judge Durant more kindly.  The addition of the 2014 MVP made the Warriors’ attack even more lethal. He was the runaway choice as the NBA Finals MVP with 30-plus points in all five games, just the sixth player in NBA history to do that. He averaged 35 points per game for the series on otherworldly shooting of 56%, 47% and 93% for field goals, three-pointers and free throws. His pull-up three-pointer in the final minute of Game 3 was arguably the biggest shot of the series.
ABC

Sure, ABC would have loved an extra game or two in this series, but the first four games marked the highest ratings for an NBA series since Michael Jordan won his sixth and final title with the Chicago Bulls in 1998. Expect Game 5 ratings to be through the roof as well. The star-laden Finals matchup was a plus after regular season ratings dipped 5% on ESPN/ABC in the first year of the league's nine-year, $24 billion media deal with Walt Disney and Time Warner.

JPMorgan Chase<br/><br/>

The banking giant was in a win-win situation with ties to both Stephen Curry and LeBron James, but the Warriors were definitely the preferred choice by JPMorgan Chase. Chase secured naming rights last year to the $1 billion arena the Warriors are set to open in 2019. The 20-year deal worth an estimated $300 million is the priciest naming rights deal ever for a U.S. arena. Curry is a key component of the bank’s “Mastery” ad campaign as well.

Joe Lacob, Peter Guber

Lacob and Guber led a group that paid $450 million for the Warriors in 2010 at a time when the Warriors had one playoff appearance in the previous 16 seasons. Good timing. The Warriors are a juggernaut on and off the court. They set the record for regular season wins with 73 in the one year they did not win the title over the past three seasons. The Warriors were worth $2.6 billion in Forbes' latest NBA franchise valuations and the on-court dominance will goose demand and pricing with the Warriors set to move into the Chase Center in 2019. Look for the Warriors to challenge the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers in years to come for the title of the NBA's most valuable team.

Steve Kerr

Steve Kerr becomes just the 14th head coach to win two NBA titles. A third would put him alone in sixth place. Kerr missed 11 straight wins by the Warriors during the postseason as Mike Brown took the reins while Kerr recovered from complications from a 2015 back surgery. Kerr’s career regular season winning percentage as a head coach over three seasons is .841, a mile ahead of second place Phil Jackson at .704. Kerr's playoff win percentage is also tops for head coaches at .758. The Cavs' Tyron Lue ranks second for playoff performance.

LeBron James<br/><br/>

James was competing in his seventh straight NBA Finals, and he proved once again that he is the best player on the planet. He wrapped his Finals run with another monster game with 41 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. James arguably deserved the Finals MVP award. He is the first player to ever average a triple-double in the Finals and the Cavs played the Warriors to a draw with LeBron on the floor, but were outscored by 28 points in the limited time James was on the bench over five games. The Cavs would have ranked among the NBA’s two worst teams with James on the bench by one metric.

LOSERS

LeBron James

James finishes on both sides of the ledger. The Warriors were huge favorites to win the 2017 NBA Finals, but the loss still hurts James in his quest to eclipse Jordan as the greatest player in NBA history. His Finals record now stands at 3-5 and the LeBron-haters will point to the huge disparity compared to Jordan, who won all six of his NBA Finals.

Teams Outside Cleveland & Oakland<br/><br/>

This year's matchup made it the first time in league history the same two teams met three straight years in the NBA Finals. We are likely looking at four straight in 12 months. The Warriors and Cavs are already overwhelming favorites in Vegas to win their respective conferences during the 2017-18 season. Golden State is the favorite at 2/3 to win the title with Cleveland next at 3/1. The Boston Celtics and San Antonio Spurs are well behind at 12/1.

NBA Fans

NBA and network execs got the Finals they wanted, but none of the games came down to the wire outside of Game 3. It concluded a dud of an NBA playoff where five of the 15 series ended in a sweep and three others lasted five games. Only two went the max seven games.
