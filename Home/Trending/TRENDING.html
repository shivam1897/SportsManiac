   Captain Virat Kohli says India are wary of Bangladesh's threat in Thursday's Champions Trophy semi-final at Edgbaston.

Defending champions India topped Group B following wins over South Africa and Pakistan, who beat England on Wednesday to reach the final.

India also thrashed Bangladesh by 240 runs in a warm-up game last month.<br/><br/>

"A lot of teams have surprised the opposition and we're not taking anything for granted," said Kohli.

"There are no guarantees in this sport. We're not going to go according to past results and what we've done in the past tournaments.

"We will use whatever momentum we've gained in this tournament to execute what we want to.

"Going into a big game like this, we're going to treat it as how we treated the last game. Our mindset does not differ."

</p>
<p>
The French international has signed a five-year contract with the Bavarian giants for a reported fee of £35million after turning down interest from both Arsenal and Chelsea.

Both London clubs as well as Juventus had been credited with interest in the 22-year-old, but Tolisso has opted to join Carlo Ancelotti at the Allianz Arena.<br><br/>

Speaking to the club’s official website, Tolisso said: "I had a wonderful time with Olympique Lyon, for whom I was very grateful. Now I'm looking forward to playing at one of the best clubs in Europe. I have set myself high goals with the Bayern. Today is a great day for me. "

The playmaker made 31 appearances in Ligue 1 last term – scoring eight goals – and drew plenty of interest across Europe for his performances both domestically and in the Europa League.

Club chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, said: "We are very happy that we were able to sign this young and highly interesting player despite strong competition from abroad. Corentin Tolisso was the dream player of Carlo Ancelotti for the midfield.”

 Pro Kabaddi League 2017: Rohit Kumar makes waves in Kabaddi world
 </h1>
 <img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/05/rohit-kumar-m.jpg?w=728"/>
 <p>
 Growing up, Rohit Kumar was destined to follow his father’s footsteps and go on to become a kabaddi player, something every boy from his town dreams off. He hails from the village of Nizampur, a town away from the hustle and bustle of New Delhi and known for producing some of the great kabaddi players for the national team like – Rakesh Kumar, Manjeet Chhillar and Amit Chhillar. Interestingly not only was Rohit’s father a kabbaddi player but so were two of his uncles.
Just like other kids of his age, nine-year old Rohit loved spending time playing kabaddi or watch his elder brothers play. “Chhotte the tab se sab ko khelte hue dekha aur ismein hi mann lagta tha. Roz kuch seekhta tha“, Rohit says. With his father’s support, he continued to follow his dream of making a name in the sport but remained focused on studies as well. However, he made his first successful step when he got into his school’s under-14 team and went on to win a gold medal for the Delhi state team. From there on it was no looking back. Right after completing his intermediate, he got a job in Indian Navy, for which he credits the sport.
With the fifth season of the Pro Kabaddi League slated to begin from July 28, Rohit became the second costliest player in the auction. He believes it was only after Manjeet’s bid, he had an idea that the franchises were willing to break the bank for Indian players.<br/><br/> when rohit tomar under the hammer, Nitin Tomar had already fetched Rs 93 lakh and everybody present at his residence was sure that the raider would cross the Rs 1 crore mark. However, confusion between Bengaluru Bulls and Patna Pirates, saw his bid end at Rs 81 lakh and the Bulls acquiring his services for another season. “Main toh heraan hogaya tha jab mere liye 25 se seedha 50 lakh ki boli lagai,” said Rohit. The 27-year old also has a fascination for cars and bikes and revealed his desire to own an Audi A6. However, keeping his desires aside Rohit said that he will give some part of his money to the families of the Indian army who have suffered the loss of their bread earner.
Rohit missed first two seasons of PBL because the Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) had denied him and other services players from competing in the league. However, it was in the third season when he was bought by Patna Pirates after a lottery system and was the third highest scorer with 109 points. He once again managed to make an impact in the next season when he finished as the second highest scorer after Telugu Titans’ Rahul Chaudhari.
Apart from playing kabaddi, the star raider, who is looking forward to taking his side to glory this season likes swimming and watching Bollywood movies. “Akshay bhai ki movies dekhna pasand hai. Unki picture dekhte hi hai chahye koi aur dekhe ya na dekhe.”
With the tournament to be played for over 3 months, Rohit is confident that his diet will keep him fit throughout and this time he will lead the top scorer list. Only time will tell whether he walks the talk.

 ICC Champions Trophy 2017: India vs Pakistan, a recurring dream
 </h1>
 <img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/05/india-pakistan-7592.jpg"/>
 <p>
 The draw for a big sporting event is always an occasion much looked forward to. In the case of a major football tournament, managers and fans wait with bated breath for what is in store for their teams. At almost every competition, one of the pools is dubbed the ‘Group of Death’ which features three or more top teams, out of which one or more will have to take the early flight home.
At tennis Grand Slams, the luck of the draw decides which fancied player has a tougher road to the title, and which journeyman faces a big star in the first round.
But FIFA World Cup , European Championships and Grand Slams are institutions in themselves regardless of the teams in contention. Also, football and tennis are sports more broad-based globally and not dependent on one or two big names or match-ups for catching eyeballs and sponsors.
That is certainly not the case with cricket, as the regular India-Pakistan encounters at global ICC events would suggest. For the fifth ICC tournament in succession, from the 2012 World T20 onwards, the two neighbours would clash in the group stage. How does this happen? Is it consciously designed or a happy coincidence for the organisers? Here is how ICC manages to ensure the two countries play each other and get themselves a financial windfall in the process.
Does ICC tailor the Champions Trophy groupings to ensure India and Pakistan fall in the same group?
Yes, they do. Last year in June, when the groups were announced, Dave Richardson, ICC chief executive, didn’t even try to hide it. “No doubt, we want to try and pit India versus Pakistan in our event. It’s hugely important from an ICC point of view. It’s massive around the world and fans have come to expect it as well, and it’s probably no coincidence that the two keep ending up in the same group. It’s fantastic for the tournament because it gives it a massive kick.”
How are the groups decided?
It’s purportedly based on rankings. The groups were formed on the basis of the eight teams’ rankings as on 30 September 2015. India were no. 2 and Pakistan no. 8 then. But the ICC has another by-rule with which they manage to draw the two teams together. The cumulative total of the rankings are equal for both groups.
So, the Group A which has Australia (ranked no 1), New Zealand (4), England (6) and Bangladesh (7) make it 18 cumulatively. And in Group B, India (2), South Africa (3), Sri Lanka (5), and Pakistan (8) sum up to 18.
What does ICC say about how they arrive at the equal figure (of 18 in this case) ?<br/><br/>
In the words of Richardson: “What we try and do is make sure that when you add up rankings of different groups, that they all add up to the same number of point. You can do that in a number of ways. You can go ‘Zig, zag’, you can go like a snake. So long as the pools are balanced, it’s silly to avoid (the fixture) when you can fairly cater for it.”
So by either zig-zaging or snaking up the ladder, ICC have ensured the money-spinners India and Pakistan are in the same group.
What about the venue?<br/><br/>
Here, too, ICC have made the smartest move possible. The Indo-Pak contest would be played in Birmingham, a city teeming with people of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. According to the 2011 census, Asian and Asian British people make up 26.6% of the population. And at least one in four people living in Birmingham were born outside UK.
In the words of Richardson, “as long as the pools are balanced, it’s silly to avoid [the India-Pakistan fixture] when you can fairly cater for it.”
What does Virat Kohli have to say about playing Pakistan?<br>
“With all due respect, it’s about playing the game that we love. Yes, an India-versus-Pakistan match is always exciting. For people watching in the stadium, the game is different. If you ask players from both sides, it is like any other game. We prepare for it like it is any other game. The atmosphere around the ground is different. But in our heads, it’s like playing against any other team. It’s not the first time we are playing against them. There is no need to motivate players any differently. If you are playing for India, there is no need for any separate motivation. Yes, you need to be passionate, but there is no need to get emotional.”
