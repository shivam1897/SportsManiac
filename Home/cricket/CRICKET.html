	 Jaydev Unadkat’s off-cutters sent Mumbai Indians (MI) off-kilter so much they almost keeled over in Sunday’s IPL 10 final against Rising Pune Supergiant. And then Mitchell Johnson produced a last over so brimming with hostility that despite conceding a first-ball four, MI managed to win the title by one run off the last ball. (RPS vs MI HIGHLIGHTS)

Chasing 130 for their first IPL title, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS) seemed to be in control but the famed MI bowling attack never really let them break loose. 23 was needed off the last two overs and RPS took 12 off the 18th bowled by Jasprit Bumrah with an inside-out six helping skipper Steve Smith bring up his half-century. (RPS vs MI SCORECARD)

Manoj Tiwary then hit Johnson for four but just when all seemed lost, the Australian pace ace struck off successive deliveries. Tiwary holed out to Kieron Pollard and Smith, having anchored the chase so well, was caught by Ambati Rayudu at the point boundary.<br/><br/>

In his disappointment, the RPS skipper didn’t cross and that meant Washington Sundar had to face Johnson. He managed to scoot a bye and then Dan Christian took a two after Hardik Pandya dropped a stiff chance. The last ball saw a misfield but RPS were never going to run three to force a tie.

After a case of never giving up despite putting up a low score --- RPS hit their first six in the 16th over --- MI players huddled so hard after Sundar was run out that it seemed someone would get hurt. They are the only team to have won three IPL titles and Rohit Sharma the only player to have won this four times.<br/><br/>

Ajinkya Rahane (44) and Smith had stabilised RPS’s chase after Rahul Tripathi’s early dismissal, a dodgy decision because replays showed Bumrah’s delivery would have missed the stumps. After Rahane went, skippers past and present, MS Dhoni and Smith, couldn’t take RPS home and then the jitters jeopardised chances of bowing out on a high.

   England v South Africa ODI: Eoin Morgan closes in on one-day record in powerful win
   </h1>
   <p>
   EOIN MORGAN ignited the summer with a brilliant century as England laid down a significant marker for the Champions Trophy against the world’s No 1 50-over team, South Africa.

   <p>
   The England skipper will take his side to Southampton today with a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series after hitting his third century of the calendar year as his side posted a 72-run victory.

And he is hoping the momentum gained can be carried through the ICC event starting on June 1 as England seek their first 50-over trophy.<br/><br/>

For all that his authority had not dipped in the dressing room, the England skipper had given himself some work to do with the powers that be following his decision not to tour Bangladesh on security grounds last October.

Some repair work was done when he stepped back into the role for the India tour. And two centuries in his last seven matches – in Cuttack and Antigua – had further cemented his return.

Yet any captain will tell you that even if there is never a bad time to post a man of the match display, laying one down on the eve of a big tournament on home soil could not be bettered.

England posted 339-6 as South Africa crumbled to 267 all out
And this was one of those days when Morgan very much set the tone, both with the bat and in the field.

Joe Root and Alex Hales set a decent stage for their captain, having rebuilt England’s innings to three figures after the departure of Jason Roy in the second over.

Morgan’s brisk 21-run partnership with Root for the third wicket and a quickstep 68 for the fourth with Ben Stokes put England in a decent position.

The loss of Stokes, who may be rested this weekend as a precaution after suffering a sore left knee, followed quickly by Jos Buttler, undermined the strong foundations, leaving England on 198-5.

   West Indies vs Afghanistan, 1st ODI: Rashid Khan spins underdogs to stunning victory

   Gros-Islet(Saint Lucia): Rashid Khan destroyed the West Indies batting line-up with outstanding figures of seven for 18 to bowl Afghanistan to a stunning 63-run victory in the opening fixture of the three-match One-Day International series at the Darren Sammy Stadium in St Lucia on Friday.

After opener Javed Ahmadi’s 81 provided the foundation for the visitors' total of 212 for six batting first, the leg-spinner Khan tore through an inept home team batting line-up to claim the fourth-best bowling figures ever in an ODI, routing the Caribbean side for 149 off 44.4 overs to take a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the second match at the same venue on Sunday.

Surprisingly brought on as the sixth bowler by his captain, Asghar Stanikzai, with the West Indies at 68 for two after 22 overs, Afghanistan's premier bowler had an instant, devastating impact, removing Jason Mohammed and debutant Roston Chase with his first two deliveries and then repeating the feat at the start of his second over by prising out top-scorer Shai Hope (35) and captain Jason Holder.

At that point he had taken four for one and he added the scalp of Ashley Nurse shortly after to have the hosts tottering at 90 for seven.<br/><br/>

Jonathan Carter and Alzarri Joseph then added 45 runs for the eighth wicket before Gulbadin Naib had Carter caught on the midwicket boundary, paving the way for Khan to return to finish off the match with the wickets of Joseph and Miguel Cummins in quick succession to seal a famous victory.

"I have worked hard on my bowling and this was a really special effort for the people of Afghanistan who have suffered so much in the past week," said Khan on receiving the 'Man of the Match' award and acknowledging the devastating truck bombing that killed more than 150 people in Kabul last week, an attack that has sparked anti-government protests.

"West Indies are a big team and to achieve this against them is brilliant."

'No explanation'

Holder was left bewildered by both his team's capitulation and the painfully slow batting which preceded it.

"There's really no explanation for what happened out there other than we were not professional in the way we went about getting those runs," he stated. "I won’t even respond to suggestions that we underestimated Afghanistan but will expect us to come with a totally different effort on Sunday."

Earlier, the Afghans were struggling to get any momentum in their innings despite Ahmadi's effort which equalled his previous best in ODI's.<br/><br/>

He never really dominated the bowling and when he eventually departed in the 37th over with the score at 131 for five, Afghanistan were desperately in need of acceleration. His innings spanned 102 deliveries and included two sixes and eight fours.

That much-needed urgency was finally injected into the innings with the arrival of Naib at the crease as he belted an unbeaten 41 off 28 deliveries, dominating an unbroken seventh-wicket partnership of 58 with Mohammad Nabi (27 not out).

Holder was the main sufferer in the late assault, conceding 36 runs off his last three overs. In an attack dominated by pacers, off-spinner Nurse emerged as the most successful of the West Indies bowlers, taking two for 34 off his ten overs.

"I knew on this pitch a total of 220 would have given us a chance," said a delighted Stanikzai. "We weren’t at our best in the T20's and I am happy we are now showing what we are capable of."
